# AI Knowledge Base API

> Note: This project is currently under update, what's coming:
> - Frontend interface

A backend service that provides a RESTful API for storing, searching, and querying user content (notes, articles, ideas) and augmenting them with local AI features such as embeddings and local LLM answers (via Ollama).

This project demonstrates backend fundamentals with an applied AI layer:

- Layered architecture (controllers, services, repositories) following the MVC pattern
- Request validation with Pydantic
- PostgreSQL persistence (configurable via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable; async driver support)
- JWT authentication and password hashing
- Unit tests for functions of all layers and the API
- AI integration for embeddings and semantic search

## v2 — Docker & Infrastructure Updates

- **Multi-stage Docker build** — dependencies are compiled in an isolated builder stage and only the final venv is copied into the lean runtime image, keeping the production image small
- **Non-root container** — the API process runs as `appuser` (UID 1001) instead of root, reducing the risk of any container escape
- **Health checks on all services** — Docker now monitors the API (`/health`), PostgreSQL (`pg_isready`), and Ollama (`ollama list`) and will restart unhealthy containers automatically
- **Automatic model provisioning** — `nomic-embed-text` and `phi3:mini` are pulled automatically when the Ollama container starts for the first time; all subsequent startups use the cached volume and skip the download
- **Persistent volumes** — Ollama models and PostgreSQL data survive container restarts via named Docker volumes (`ollama_data`, `postgres_data`)
- **Internal networking** — Ollama is no longer exposed on a host port; all inter-service communication happens over Docker's internal network

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) and Docker Compose
- Or Python 3.11+ for local development without Docker

## Stack

- Python
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- PostgreSQL
- SQLAlchemy
- Uvicorn
- Pytest
- Docker

## AI Stack

- Embeddings via `nomic-embed-text` (Ollama) for semantic search
- Cosine similarity search implemented in Python
- `Ollama` + `phi3:mini` for local LLM generation and QA

## Key Dependencies

- `fastapi` — web framework
- `uvicorn` — ASGI server
- `pydantic` — request/response validation
- `bcrypt` — password hashing
- `jose` — JWT tokens
- `httpx` — asynchronous requests for Ollama/embedding integration

## Project Structure

- `run.py` — local run entrypoint
- `app/server/server.py` — FastAPI application factory
- `app/controllers/` — route definitions and routers: `user_controller.py`, `note_controller.py`, `ai_controller.py`, `auth_controller.py`
- `app/services/` — business logic for users, notes and AI
- `app/repositories/` — persistence layer for users and notes
- `app/models/` — domain models
- `app/schemas/` — Pydantic schemas for requests/responses
- `app/database/` — database setup and helpers — supports PostgreSQL via `DATABASE_URL` and `asyncpg`
- `app/core/` — auth & security helpers
- `app/ai_settings/` — AI integration clients and helpers (Ollama client, embedding client)
- `api_tests/` and `app/services/*_test.py` — automated tests

## Installation

### Option 1 — Using Docker

Docker will set up the API, PostgreSQL, and Ollama automatically.

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/kevincontri/AI-Knowledge-Base-API.git
cd AI-Knowledge-Base-API
```

2. Start all services

```
docker compose up --build
```

This will:

- Build and start the API on `http://localhost:8000`
- Start a PostgreSQL instance with persistent storage
- Start an Ollama instance and automatically pull `nomic-embed-text` and `phi3:mini` (first run only — models are cached in a volume)

3. Open the interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`
---

### Option 2 — Local development (without Docker)

1. Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/kevincontri/AI-Knowledge-Base-API.git
cd AI-Knowledge-Base-API
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment
   
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3. Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Configure the database connection

Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable to point at your PostgreSQL instance:

```
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/ai_knowledge_db"
```

5. Install Ollama and pull the required models

Follow the [official Ollama installation](https://ollama.com) for your OS, then run:

```
ollama pull phi3:mini
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

6. Start the server

```
python run.py
```

Open the interactive docs at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

## Authentication

Authentication uses JWT bearer tokens and hashed passwords. Typical flow:

- Register a user via the users route
- Login with credentials to receive an `access_token`
- Include the token in requests as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for protected endpoints

The project contains `app/core/auth.py` and `app/core/security.py` for token creation and credential verification.

## API Highlights

Routes are organized in `app/controllers/`:

- **Users** — list users
- **Auth** — register user and login to receive JWT tokens
- **Notes** — create, read, update, and delete personal notes associated with an author (by it's user id)
- **AI Endpoints** — semantic search using embeddings and cosine similarity; prompt enhancement and local LLM answering via Ollama

## Tests

```
pytest -q
```

## Future Improvements

- Add refresh tokens
- Expand AI features
- Deploy to cloud
